## Access Key

This version of Porcupine requires an access key from Picovoice to function. To get an access key:

1. Create a free account at [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/)
2. Create a new access key in the console
3. Copy the key and paste it into the "access_key" field in the add-on configuration

## Configuration

Example configuration:

```yaml
access_key: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
sensitivity: 0.5
language: en
debug_logging: false
```

### Option: `access_key` (required)

The access key from Picovoice Console. See above for instructions on obtaining the key.

### Option: `sensitivity` (optional)

The sensitivity of wake word detection (0-1). A higher value increases sensitivity, potentially leading to more false activations. A lower value makes detection more strict but may require louder/clearer speech.

Default value: `0.5`

### Option: `language` (optional)

The language for wake word detection. Currently supported languages:

- `en` - English
- `es` - Spanish
- `fr` - French
- `de` - German

Default value: `en`

### Option: `debug_logging` (optional)

Controls whether additional debug information should be logged.

Default value: `false`
